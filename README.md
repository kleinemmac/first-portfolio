# My Awkward First Portfolio
Honestly, please don't clone this. It is a source of great shame for me.

## Purpose:
The idea behind this project was simply to establish a starting point. For this reason, it is hideous and looks like something a mid-90's teen blogger would be proud of. I completed this project before doing any coding courses. These were dark times.

## Technologies:
This is a very simple site and only uses HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I used Adobe xD to build designs before creating the site. 

## Things I Learned:
This project helped me get a better handle on proper scaffolding in HTML. It also led me to the (at the time) mind-shattering realization that the z-index exists. At this point, CSS and Bootstrap were major struggles for me. By the end of this project, I felt much more confident in both of those areas and moved on to some online courses in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Some specific concepts I learned while stumbling through this project include:

-Adobe xD basics
-basic HTML scaffolding
-how to utilize Bootstrap
-how to write CSS while crying
-how to wrap text using spans
-how to manipulate z-index
-how to embed an image
-the difference between container and container-fluid
-how to manipulate column size
-how to adjust padding, margin, justification, and alignment
-how to utilize Google Fonts
